Most of us when we get a new vehicle (in my case its a bike), at least for the first few days are filled with joy of owning it and trying out all the features that it provides. Its a joy like no other.

Riding is fun as long we take care to do things within our limits. When the sun is out and the roads are dry its a pleasure to ride with full throttle, enjoy the wind beating at you and feel the joy of being free. Now comes the rainy season (which is my favorite season). And its a totally another story to ride in the rain. Many will tell that they donâ€™t enjoy getting wet and not having any visibility (we still havenâ€™t got any wipers to our helmets yet ðŸ˜› ). Riding is tough but many will love the challenge that it poses to riding.

I had the opportunity to ride in the rain and it was one of the most exhilarating experiences of my life. I was on my way home from office when the rain started. It was beating down hard, only trucks on the roads and almost zero visibility and this was around 8 in the evening. Out of nowhere it was like a dream come true. Riding in the rain at night and no other 2-wheelers on the road. One thing that came to my mind at that time was driving in wet weather conditions in F1 2013 game about being smooth on the acceleration, braking and taking the curves smoothly. I just took it smoothly and ended with a good experience !
