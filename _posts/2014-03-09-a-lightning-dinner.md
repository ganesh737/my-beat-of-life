The usual concept for a nice dinner can be a good food coupled with a ambience like that provided by candles or by moonlight. In my case it was good food coupled with light from all the lightning!!! It was an amazing experience to have that kind of lightning without much thunder to lighten the dinner.

I was on a trip to Mangalore during Deepavali holidays last year. Its pretty nice place with lots of greenery. On the last day of the trip, we were sitting outside for dinner at around 8pm and there you have it, no power. It was a sad feeling but on a positive note the evening started with lighting candles to bring light into the darkness. A cloudy night was about start with candle light dinner. It was a setting of pure ambience which I loved but the Rain God had other plans. Turned out that Rain God had a special plan for us that night, that of lightning without much thunder and little rain. It was really great to have our food lit up by all the lightning and an experience I will never forget.
