We all think of our childhood days now and then (can vary from person to person :P). I am reminiscing it now. You know, for most Indians its all about playing gully cricket, breaking windows and running off to hide. But for me it was about convincing everyone for a test match so that our team could bat all day along and the opposite team would bowl all day long ( and the match wouldnâ€™t end :P). We used to play on an playground near our home and it would take all our strength to hit a sixer. My memories on cricket also include playing with my family whenever I would go to my grandparents place at Puttur (a place near Mangalore), my native. I recollect using the midrib of the leaves from coconut trees as a bat and tennis balls. Since my grandparents place was on a farm, I vaguely remember hitting the ball into a pond where we would not find it, hitting it into bushes we could not enter and sometimes onto the top of the house(it had tile roof) which had a weird way  of finding a hole into the house. The last one made us all wonder how we did not end up drenched at night when it rained hard.

Coming back, other than cricket, I remember playing football with friends after school. I would end up going home late to momâ€™s scoldings. Then have a hot glass milk because growing children need milk :P. After all this playing, we ended up creating the first football team for our school. We participated in only one tournament. If I remember correctly, our principal did not want us in any more tournaments since we were going to write our 10th standard exams in another few months (its India after all). It was really fun.

But before all these, I remember the time that dad used hold the back of my cycle to teach me how to ride my cycle. On days that he wasnâ€™t there to hold, I used to try to ride on my own and would end up hitting a guyâ€™s moped all the time. It used to fall and then I would run till I did not have any breath left. It was really fun to watch that guy come out to see his moped on the ground and me running at full speed. After learning to ride, the time was now ripe to ride from home to school on bike. I really enjoyed riding to school, especially in the rain. It was really fun where I could get completely drenched in rain (mom used to be really angry but that didnâ€™t stop me). I used to ride my cycle through large puddles and loved splashing water :). After that I started going on long rides on my bike, around 40kms in a day. Along with all these, I used to try to chase motor cycle so that I could prove that I could be faster. I remember that once my friend got his motored two wheeler and I was on my cycle, I did 18km/hr (I had a gear-less cycle).

And beyond these I love cars and especially HotWheels cars. I remember asking for a new HotWheels car all the time, especially when I got sick. Dad used to go nuts every time that I asked ðŸ˜€

Above all, I feel that it is all these memories that make us what we are and make us remember what we want to do.
