It all started with the thought of wanting to take a long ride away from the hubbub of the city and take a ride along the empty spaces beyond it. I have always liked to discover things on my own. So it began with the ride to quench my thirst for the free air and travelling through the expanses of the Deccan Plateau, plus get to smell the fresh air of the western ghats.

The journey started with a ride along the Mysore Road (from Bangalore). I was amazed at the number of restaurants and Cafe Coffee Day present on that road. When I used to travel through the same road back in 2002, it used to be a completely empty but now it has got a restaurant every few kilometers. I ended up having my breakfast in a proper restaurant.

Then took a right turn to take the road to Coorg. This was once again an uneventful journey till Suntikoppa, where I took to the unknown roads from there to Sakleshpura. I did chart out the route on Google Maps for an hour or two and but its still not the same as travelling there.

Anyway now starts the journey through the state highway towards Somwarpet. At first, looking at the sight in front of my eyes, I just stopped on the side of the road for a few minutes to take in the surroundings, and  somewhere I felt that this, was where I belonged (coincidentally it is also close to my native). The ride felt awesome and I was singing a song all the way to Somwarpet. This is when I realized that I needed to fill the bikes tummy, which was nearing quarter of a tank and who knew when the next gas station would be. I asked for directions and was directed towards the route I had mapped out. It was once again a repeat of riding in the canopy of trees. I did notice  a farm house in the middle of it all and would love to someday visit that place for a long vacation.

After Somwarpet, I was supposed to encounter two bridge crossings and mother nature was in a mood to show her best side that day with the cloudy weather and rain appearing on a distant mountain with the river to provide the scenic view from the bridge. I was mesmerised by her beauty and no words can describe it.

And next I came across the Hemavathi river. The ride for here on for another 5kms was along the banks of Hemavathi and as always it was fun to ride.

The next section was an uphill climb towards Sakleshpura, and along the way I came across this hill with a tree atop the it with swings attached to it. The grass surrounding the tree was perfect for a picnic, the kind of grass that is not very dense yet so soft. There were a few kids climbing, playing and I was not going to disturb them. After this started the really curvy roads of the Ghat as I neared Sakleshpura. I also found a new route to Subrahmanya here, that I had never gone through before (Must try on my next trip around this place).

The road after this joined near the Shiradi Ghat end point, just near to Sakleshpura.

From here on it was a straightforward trip back home on the highway. On the whole I would love to do it again and again, might not ever get bored of this route.

P.S: Initially thought of using the title as To There and Back Again but its already used somewhere (you know !)
