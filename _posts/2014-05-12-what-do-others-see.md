When we were kids, we used have our parents or grandparents narrate stories of the past, or about mythology or a random story they heard when they were kids. This feeling of listening to a story is quite different from viewing it, like  a story play out in a drama or in a movie. I came across a strange movie that felt like I was sitting and listening to a story rather watching one. This is none other than the recent Kannada (language) movie – Ulidavaru Kandante (meaning “As seen by the rest”).

I hadn’t seen any Kannada movie in the recent past since the main theme is usually fighting, love story and such. After  a lot of great reviews in from all my friends, I thought of watching this movie out of curiosity. I was expecting it to reflect the saying – “Curiosity killed the cat” and end up never to watch another Kannada movie in the future. It turned out that I was wrong by a mile. This was an exceptional movie. The screenplay along with the actors played their part well. Altogether a really good movie.

The movie flows with the stories as expressed by the characters. So the story telling is done from a third person's view point. This made me think of my life. It provoked me to look inward with the question - “How do others see me?”
