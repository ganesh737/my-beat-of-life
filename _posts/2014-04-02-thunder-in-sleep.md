Imagine being in a deep sleep. Now, you hear a terrible sound that wakes you up. You open your eyes and find that you are traveling in a bus and not sleeping at home as you expected to be. You look around and find that everyone else is awake, looking shocked! On closer inspection of your surroundings you find that the window that was supposed to be the “Emergency Exit” is no more.

Now, lets get back to where it all started! I had this weird experience while traveling last month. Such cases are pretty rare but the window breaking without anything visual stimulus is a little unnerving at such a time. It turns out that the material used for these windows are a little different i.e., they are a little brittle and easier to break through using the emergency hammer. So they tend to be affected by the vibrations of the bus. Overall a weird experience it is.
